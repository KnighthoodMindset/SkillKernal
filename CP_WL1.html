        <h3>Introduction - Part 1</h3>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h4>1. Understanding Cybersecurity</h4>
        <p>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, theft, damage, or misuse. It focuses on safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h5>Key Concepts in Cybersecurity</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><abbr>Data:</abbr> The information stored or transferred in systems.</li>
            <li><abbr>Vulnerability:</abbr> Weaknesses in systems that attackers can exploit.</li>
            <li><abbr>Unauthorized Access:</abbr> When someone gains access to information without permission.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In simple terms, cybersecurity is about building a protective layer that prevents hackers and unauthorized users from misusing your digital assets.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h4>2. Understanding Privacy</h4>
        <p>Privacy is about controlling your personal information — deciding what you want to share, with whom, and under what conditions. It involves ensuring that personal data is not used without consent.</p>
        <p><strong>Example: </strong>You might share your phone number with a friend but not with a company you haven’t interacted with. Privacy protects such personal decisions.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h4>3. The Connection Between Cybersecurity and Privacy</h4>
        <p>Cybersecurity and privacy are closely related but different:</p>
        <li><abbr title="Cybersecurity">Cybersecurity:</abbr> Protects systems and data from threats.</li>
        <li><abbr>Privacy:</abbr> Ensures control over personal information.</li>
        <p>The intersection of these two fields is where many modern digital safety issues occur. For example, even if your data is secured from hackers, privacy concerns arise if your data is shared without your consent by the service provider.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h4>4. Real-Life Example: Phishing Attacks</h4>
        <p>Phishing is a common cybersecurity threat where attackers send fraudulent messages to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information.</p>
        <p><strong>Example from the video transcript:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>An email appeared to be from the Director of IIT Madras requesting a meeting.</li>
            <li>At first glance, the email looked legitimate, with the sender’s name and signature.</li>
            <li>But on closer inspection, the email address was from Gmail — not the official IIT domain.</li>
            <li>The wording also seemed unusual for a professional email.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is a form of phishing — specifically spear phishing, where attackers use personal details to make the email convincing. Spear phishing is more dangerous because it is tailored to target specific individuals or organizations.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h4>5. Another Example: Fake Bank Messages</h4>
        <p>Attackers often send fake messages that look like they come from trusted organizations (like banks). These messages usually contain links to fraudulent websites that mimic real ones.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>A message asking the user to verify their PAN card through a link claiming to be the SBI website.</li>
            <li>The site looked authentic, with the bank logo and layout, but the website address was fake.</li>
            <li>When users log in, their details get stolen.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><abbr>Lesson:</abbr> Always check the sender and website address before entering personal information.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h4>6. Ransomware Attacks</h4>
        <p>Ransomware is another common cyber threat. It occurs when hackers take control of a computer system or data by encrypting it and demand payment to release access.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>In 2021, several retail stores in the West stopped functioning because hackers attacked the POS (Point of Sale) software provided by Kaseya.</li>
            <li>Hackers demanded $70 million to restore operations.</li>
            <li>In most cases, businesses pay the ransom because the cost of downtime is higher than paying the attacker.</li>
            <li>In Chennai, India, the municipal corporation’s PCs were attacked. They refused to pay because their systems were outdated and vulnerable anyway.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><abbr>Analogy:</abbr> It’s like coming back home to find another lock placed on your door and the thief demanding money to give you the key.</p>

        <h4>7. Cybersecurity in Healthcare</h4>
        <p>Healthcare data is extremely sensitive because leaks can cause embarrassment, financial loss, or harm to individuals.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>In late 2022, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) faced a cyberattack where five servers were compromised.</li>
            <li>This incident exposed sensitive health data, which is a significant concern worldwide.</li>
            <li>In countries like the USA, there are specific laws (like HIPAA) to protect healthcare data because of its sensitive nature.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h4>8. The Current Cybersecurity Landscape</h4>
        <p>Cybersecurity threats are increasing in frequency and severity. Nearly <strong>91% of organizations</strong> experience at least one cybersecurity incident each year. Cybersecurity is no longer just an IT issue — it is a <strong>strategic priority for managers and organizational leaders</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>Real-world impact:</strong> Cyberattacks affect various domains:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Manufacturing (e.g., Kirloskar attacks)</li>
            <li>Healthcare (e.g., AIIMS attack)</li>
            <li>Government services (e.g., Chennai Corporation ransomware)</li>
            <li>Banking and finance</li>
            <li>Retail and logistics</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h4>9. Bright Side & Dark Side of Digital Transformation</h4>
        <p>The digital world has two faces:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bright side:</strong> Technology enables faster communication, economic growth, automation, and innovation.</li>
            <li><strong>Dark side:</strong> Cyber threats exploit vulnerabilities, causing financial losses, reputational damage, and breaches of privacy.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This reality makes cybersecurity a critical area of concern for everyone, not just technical professionals.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h4>10. Why Cybersecurity Matters to Everyone</h4>
        <p>Cybersecurity is not just an IT concern — it impacts everyone in modern society. From individuals to organizations, a breach in cybersecurity can cause:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Financial loss</li>
            <li>Data theft</li>
            <li>Loss of privacy</li>
            <li>Operational downtime</li>
            <li>Reputation damage</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Thus, understanding cybersecurity and privacy is essential for anyone who uses digital systems, especially managers responsible for safeguarding organizational assets.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>In summary, cybersecurity is the protective layer for data and systems, while privacy is the control over who sees and uses your data. Together, they protect against growing threats such as phishing, ransomware, and data breaches. In today’s digital world, cybersecurity is a vital priority for individuals and organizations alike.</p>
