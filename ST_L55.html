        <h3>Non functional system testing</h3>
    </section>
    <section>
      <p>In software testing, system-level testing is broadly categorized into functional and nonfunctional testing. Functional testing validates that the software meets its specified requirements using techniques such as white-box or black-box testing, while nonfunctional testing evaluates the system against quality attributes defined by standards like NISS, which include around sixty-four metrics often ending in “-ility” or “-ty.” Nonfunctional testing typically begins at the system level, although planning for it starts during requirements and architectural design, where the system’s architecture ensures adherence to quality parameters.
</p>
      <p>Nonfunctional system testing includes multiple types. Interoperability testing ensures that a system can operate with other software, hardware, or platforms across operating systems, languages, and devices, with compatibility testing focusing on variations in OS, browsers, databases, and forward/backward compatibility between versions. Security testing assesses whether the system protects sensitive data, maintains confidentiality, integrity, and availability, and validates authentication and authorization policies. It also identifies potential backdoors, verifies encryption and decryption mechanisms, and tests protocols across multiple layers. Reliability testing measures a system’s ability to function continuously over extended periods, encompassing both hardware and software reliability, often using statistical methods.
</p>
      <p>Scalability testing evaluates whether a system can handle increasing loads, such as a large number of concurrent users or database operations, while maintaining response times and performance commitments. Documentation testing verifies that user manuals, tutorials, and online help are accurate, readable, and functionally correct, including checks for grammar, graphics, indexing, and installation procedures. Regulatory testing ensures compliance with domain-specific standards and safety-critical regulations, such as avionics (DO standards), automotive (IEC 61508, MISRA), or food and consumer products (FSSAI, CE, FCC).
</p>
      <p>Performance testing, a key nonfunctional test, measures system responsiveness and stability under various workloads, including metrics such as throughput, server response time, and concurrent users. Common performance tests include load testing, which evaluates system behavior under expected loads; stress testing, which tests system limits beyond expected loads; soak or endurance testing, which measures performance under sustained loads; and spike testing, which examines system response to sudden increases in load. Performance testing is supported by tools like HP LoadRunner, NeoLoad, JMeter (open-source), Rational Performance Tester, and Gatling (open-source), which generate and execute test scripts while monitoring critical system parameters through separate scripts or external devices to avoid affecting system performance.
</p>
      <p>Although this lecture provided an overview of nonfunctional system testing, it did not cover regression testing (to be addressed separately), usability testing, graphical user interface testing, or in-depth security and reliability testing, all of which are substantial areas of ongoing research and practice.
