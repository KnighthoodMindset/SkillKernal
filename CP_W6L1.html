        <h3>Risk Management - Part 1</h3>
    </section>
    <section>
      <p>Risk management in cybersecurity is a structured process that focuses on identifying, assessing, and reducing risks to an organization’s assets. Unlike contingency planning, which is reactive and focuses on protecting business processes after incidents occur, risk management is proactive and focuses on protecting assets to prevent incidents. The two core aspects of risk management are “knowing yourself” and “knowing the enemy.” Knowing yourself involves identifying and understanding your assets, their value, and your preparedness to protect them, while knowing the enemy involves understanding external and internal threats that could exploit vulnerabilities.
</p>
      <p>Risk management follows three main phases: <abbr>risk identification, risk assessment,</abbr> and <abbr>risk control</abbr>. Risk identification involves listing all cyber assets that need protection — including people, procedures, policies, data, software, hardware, and network components — and understanding the threats and vulnerabilities related to each. Assets should be tagged, documented, and classified systematically in an asset database. Asset classification includes identifying attributes such as ownership, sensitivity level, access rights, and criticality. For example, data classification might include categories such as public, sensitive, confidential, secret, and top secret, with access restricted according to sensitivity. People are also treated as assets and classified by security clearance and access rights.
</p>
      <p>Risk assessment is the process of evaluating the value of assets and understanding the likelihood and impact of threats. This includes estimating <abbr>loss frequency</abbr> (the probability of a threat materializing and overcoming protection measures) and <abbr>loss magnitude</abbr> (the impact of the attack on the asset’s value to the organization). Asset value is not measured purely by purchase cost but by its importance to the organization’s operations, revenue, profitability, and public image. For example, a critical e-commerce server may have a higher asset value than individual office PCs because an attack on it could stop the entire business operation. Organizations often use weighted scoring models to assess asset values based on criteria such as revenue impact, profitability, and public image.
</p>
      <p>Risk control is the stage where management makes decisions on how to address identified risks. This includes selecting mitigation measures, justifying investments in protection, and continuously monitoring the risk environment. Risk management is not a one-time process but an ongoing cycle, as new threats and vulnerabilities constantly emerge. A key concept in risk management is <abbr>residual risk</abbr>, which is the risk that remains after safeguards are implemented. Even with basic protection measures — such as built-in operating system security features — and additional safeguards like antivirus software or firewalls, some vulnerabilities remain, often due to unpatched systems or human error. The purpose of risk management is not to eliminate risk entirely but to reduce it to an acceptable level, balancing protection efforts with business priorities and costs.
</p>
      <p>Ultimately, effective cybersecurity risk management requires a clear understanding of assets, threats, and vulnerabilities, systematic classification of assets, quantitative and qualitative risk assessment, and a proactive strategy for reducing residual risk while continuously adapting to a dynamic cyber threat landscape.
