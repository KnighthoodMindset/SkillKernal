        <h3>Risk Management - Part 3</h3>
    </section>

      <p>The case study <abbr>Protecting the Cheddar</abbr> focuses on the Newhouse Cheese Company, a business founded in 1811 that grew through innovation and digitalization but later became vulnerable to cyber threats. In the early 2000s, under the leadership of the fifth-generation CEO Chadwick “Chad” Newhouse, the company invested heavily in digital precision control systems for production. However, a ransomware attack compromised their systems, forcing Chad to pay $49,999 to regain control. This incident triggered a crisis meeting involving top executives, including the CEO, CISO, CFO, deputy CEO, and a cybersecurity consultant, to address the breach.</p>
      <p>The deputy CEO, Sara, questioned the need for full digitization, suggesting that overly complex software and constant remote access increased vulnerability. She proposed reducing digital pathways and incorporating more manual control to mitigate risks. Over the following weeks, the consultant, Jack Parem, conducted an extensive evaluation involving four steps: identifying critical information and processes, mapping the digital environment, identifying likely attack vectors, and generating risk-based recommendations. He found three major points of failure, including multiple pathways into the network and compromised control systems. His recommendations included taking the thermization process offline, removing or backstopping automated temperature controls with manual controls, and safeguarding critical recipe data.</p>
      <p>A heated discussion followed, with executives debating whether to revert to manual controls. Concerns were raised about operational efficiency, human error, cost implications, and the impact on investor trust. Proponents of the hybrid approach suggested selectively moving only the most critical systems offline or restricting access within a local environment. This would isolate vital assets while retaining the advantages of automation, such as efficiency and predictive maintenance, without fully reverting to pre-digital operations.</p>
      <p>The case study illustrates key challenges of industrial cybersecurity in the era of IoT and Industry 4.0, where digitalization increases both efficiency and risk. Ransomware attacks, like those experienced globally (e.g., WannaCry, NotPetya), can cripple operations, cause financial loss, damage reputation, and in extreme cases, threaten public safety — especially in industries like food production where control systems directly impact quality and safety. The case highlights that risk management must balance technological advancement with cybersecurity, possibly through partial rollback, segmentation, or manual backups, and underscores the importance of threat intelligence and proactive contingency planning.</p>
