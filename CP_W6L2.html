        <h3>Risk Management - Part 2</h3>
    </section>
    <section>
      <p>In risk management, after identifying and valuing assets, the next step is identifying and assessing threats. Cyber threats are numerous, potentially running into hundreds, and cannot all be discussed individually. Threat intelligence is crucial — it provides informed, up-to-date information about current threats, their likelihood, frequency, and impact. This intelligence is generally obtained from professional bodies or subscriptions, as it is dynamic and not available in textbooks. Threats, like assets, need classification for effective management. Threat classification helps manage complexity, with common categories including human error, intellectual property compromises, espionage, information extortion, and technological obsolescence. Technological obsolescence, for example, is a threat when outdated systems lack updates, increasing vulnerability. Threats can be quantitatively assessed and ranked using threat intelligence data, producing weighted rankings based on likelihood and severity.
</p>
      <p>Once assets and threats are identified, their combination must be evaluated to assess vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities exist at the intersection of specific threats and specific assets. This requires vulnerability assessment, which identifies gaps in protection for each asset-threat pair. Vulnerability assessment is typically documented in a Threat–Vulnerability–Asset (TVA) worksheet, which systematically charts vulnerabilities across all assets and threats. This enables prioritization of critical vulnerabilities based on asset value and threat ranking.
</p>
      <p>Risk assessment involves quantifying risk using two key measures: loss frequency and loss magnitude. Loss frequency is the product of the probability of an attack occurring and the probability of success if the attack happens. Loss magnitude, or asset exposure, combines the value of the asset with the percentage of the asset likely to be compromised in an attack. The overall residual risk is calculated as:
</p>
      <p style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold;">
  Residual Risk = (Loss Frequency × Loss Magnitude) − (% Risk Mitigated by Current Controls) + Measurement Uncertainty
</p>

      <p>Measurement uncertainty accounts for estimation errors, as loss frequency and magnitude are often qualitative or approximate values. For example, if an e-commerce database has a 10% chance of attack and a 50% chance of success, with an asset value of 50 and an 80% exposure rate, loss frequency would be 0.05 and loss magnitude 40, giving a risk value of 2. Considering a 25% measurement uncertainty, the residual risk would be 2.5.
</p>
      <p>This quantitative approach to risk assessment is a structured process, but in practice it can be challenging due to the difficulty of obtaining exact data, and many organizations often rely on qualitative assessment. Once risks are assessed, the next phase is risk mitigation, which involves deciding on controls, investments, and monitoring to manage the identified residual risks effectively.
