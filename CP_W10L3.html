      <h4>Equifax Data Breach – Case Study</h4>
      <p>Equifax, founded in 1899, is a major credit reporting company based in the United States that serves over 820 million consumers and 91 million businesses globally. It collects and processes sensitive personal data, including income, employment details, credit history, and other financial information, to assess creditworthiness. Its operations are divided into three segments: U.S. Information Services (collecting and selling customer data), Workforce Solutions (providing employment and income history to organizations), and Global Consumer Solutions (offering credit monitoring and identity theft protection).
</p>
      <p>Despite significant investments in cybersecurity—over 1% of operating revenue annually between 2014 and 2017—and maintaining specialized teams such as the Global Threat and Vulnerability Management (GTVM), Vulnerability Assessment Team (VAT), and Countermeasures team, Equifax suffered one of the largest data breaches in history in 2017. The breach compromised sensitive personal data, including names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses, driver’s license details, credit card information, passport numbers, and tax IDs, affecting approximately 143 million U.S. consumers, additional data from 2.5 million people, and records of about 7 lakh UK customers.
</p>
      <p>The breach began due to a vulnerability in Apache Struts, an open-source software widely used in financial services. Despite being warned in March 2017 by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and cybersecurity firms such as Mandiant, Equifax failed to patch the vulnerability for over five months. Hackers exploited this gap, creating backdoors via web shells and bypassing security measures due to expired SSL certificates and outdated internal systems. This negligence was compounded by unclear roles in patch management, lack of accountability, outdated technology, poor integration of systems, insufficient personnel for security, and weak internal controls. Multiple prior incidents—from 2013 to 2016—indicated security lapses that were not addressed.
</p>
      <p>The breach response was slow and poorly communicated. Public disclosure happened six weeks after detection, and Equifax faced criticism for delayed alerts, charging customers for credit freezes, and a controversial clause preventing lawsuits from customers using their offered protection services. Following the breach, key executives including the CSO, CIO, CEO, and chairman resigned. Stock prices dropped by 35%, lawsuits were filed, and regulatory inquiries were initiated. New regulations, such as the Freedom from Equifax Exploitation Act, were proposed to strengthen breach disclosure requirements and improve fraud prevention.
</p>
      <p>Analysis of the breach highlights governance failures as the core issue, including ineffective communication between security and IT teams, absence of proactive vulnerability patching, lack of accountability, and failure to act on prior security warnings and audit reports. This case underscores that cybersecurity is not solely a technical matter but a corporate governance and regulatory issue. It also demonstrates the need for strict oversight, clear roles and responsibilities, timely patch management, and robust breach disclosure protocols to protect consumer data and maintain public trust.
