        <h3>Information privacy: Economics and strategy - Part 3</h3>
    </section>
    <section>
      <p>Different industries are perceived differently regarding privacy, with <strong>trust varying significantly across sectors</strong>. A 2019 McKinsey survey indicated that <abbr>healthcare and financial services</abbr> generally enjoy higher customer trust in handling personal data, whereas <abbr>retail, automotive, and government sectors</abbr> have much lower trust levels, sometimes as low as 10%. This highlights that establishing and maintaining customer trust in data practices can serve as a significant strategic advantage, particularly for companies in low-trust sectors like retail. Effective ethical management of data can be guided by principles inspired by GDPR: purpose limitation (using data only for declared purposes), transparency (informing customers and providing control over data sharing), and data minimization (collecting only necessary information and enabling deletion upon request). Despite these frameworks, many companies engage in selective disclosure, undermining transparency and reducing customer confidence.
</p>
      <p>A key concern is that <strong>customers often have limited control</strong> over how their data is processed or shared, and they may not fully understand the terms of loyalty programs or service agreements. Examples like Amazon’s pricing strategies demonstrate how data can be used opportunistically, charging loyal customers differently for the same products, underscoring the <strong>ethical risks of data misuse</strong>. While regulations such as GDPR aim to mitigate such risks, gaps remain in effectively protecting consumers.
</p>
      <p>From a strategic perspective, data sharing offers competitive advantages for companies like IFA, allowing them to develop personalized products and services based on analytics. However, challenges persist, including evolving regulations, reliance on third-party data providers like ShopSense, and the risk of opportunism, where data suppliers could alter terms or access. This creates uncertainty, as the key resource—data—is not fully controlled by the company leveraging it. In strategic theory, this aligns with the distinction between the <abbr>Resource-Based View (RBV)</abbr> and the <abbr>Knowledge-Based View (KBV)</abbr>: while data itself may not be proprietary, the knowledge derived from it can provide a sustainable competitive advantage.
</p>
      <p>A major ethical concern is that customers, whose data is being exchanged, are excluded from the decision-making process. Aligning company interests with customer rights remains a challenge. One proposed solution is the creation of <strong>joint products between retailers and insurance companies</strong>, where customers are explicitly informed about data sharing and given the choice to <strong>opt in or out</strong>. These programs could offer tangible benefits, such as discounts or lower premiums, in exchange for consent. Practical hurdles include ensuring meaningful consent, as most customers tend to ignore notices or terms, and clearly communicating the program’s purpose and benefits. A joint product model provides a more ethical and transparent approach, aligning business strategy with customer rights, whereas current practices, though legally permissible, raise ethical questions regarding privacy and informed consent.
