      <p>The growing issue of <abbr>internet insecurity</abbr> has become a major global concern due to the rapid increase in cyberattacks across various sectors such as government, healthcare, education, energy, telecommunications, transportation, and water treatment. Between 2021 and 2022, cyber incidents rose sharply as digital systems became more interconnected and interdependent. The increasing complexity of critical infrastructures has made them easier targets for attackers, as seen in major incidents involving Saudi Aramco, South Korean nuclear plants, Indian power grids, and Ukraine’s energy networks. Despite global cybersecurity spending expected to reach over $460 billion by 2025, organizations still struggle to stay protected. The rise of digital transformation—accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic—has further expanded vulnerabilities through the integration of technologies like IoT, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cloud computing. These advancements, while beneficial, have also created new attack surfaces and made it difficult for companies to identify all potential weaknesses in their systems.
</p>
      <p>Traditional cyber hygiene practices such as regular patching, password complexity, employee training, and network segmentation offer some protection but are no longer sufficient to handle sophisticated, targeted attacks. Many industries face challenges like incomplete asset inventories, large-scale operations, and interlinked systems that make it impossible to secure every digital component. To overcome these limitations, experts propose a new security framework known as <strong>Consequence-Driven Cyber Informed Engineering (CCE)</strong> and <strong>Cyber Informed Engineering (CIE)</strong>, developed by Idaho National Laboratory (INL). CCE focuses on identifying and protecting the most critical operational functions—known as “Crown Jewels.” It aims to reduce digital exposure, build redundancy, and ensure that essential operations continue even during a cyberattack. This approach treats cybersecurity not as a purely technical problem but as an issue of operational survival.
</p>
      <p><abbr>Cyber Informed Engineering (CIE)</abbr> complements CCE by integrating cybersecurity into the system’s design and engineering phases rather than adding it after development. It ensures that security considerations are built into the architecture from the very beginning. The INL model follows a structured four-step process: identifying critical functions, mapping digital terrain and attack pathways, eliminating or reducing vulnerabilities, and implementing strong mitigation measures. A key aspect of this framework is thinking like an adversary—understanding how attackers might exploit weaknesses and proactively closing those gaps.
</p>
      <p>This approach also encourages organizations to limit over-reliance on digital systems by incorporating <abbr>analog redundancies</abbr> and maintaining manual backups where possible. It promotes a culture of cyber awareness and accountability across all levels of an organization. Although the implementation of CCE and CIE may initially require significant investment and effort, they provide long-term benefits by enhancing resilience, ensuring continuity, and reducing the consequences of potential attacks. Ultimately, this model represents a <abbr>fundamental shift in cybersecurity philosophy</abbr>—moving from reactive protection to proactive, consequence-driven defense, where security is viewed as an essential part of system engineering and organizational strategy.
