        <h3>Privacy: Strategy and Safety - Part 2</h3>
    </section>
    <section>
      <p>In recent years, governments have increasingly pushed for mandatory backdoor access to encrypted devices, arguing it is essential for law enforcement and national security. A notable case occurred between October 2014 and June 2015, when the Manhattan District Attorney’s office could not access potential evidence in 74 of 92 cases involving iOS 8 due to Apple’s default full-disk encryption. Former FBI Director James Comey argued that such encryption hinders investigations and shields criminals from conviction, making encrypted devices the decisive factor between justice and acquittal. Politicians have therefore demanded that companies include default solutions enabling government access. Critics, however, warn that mandatory backdoors could stifle innovation, as the evolving nature of technology would make it difficult for governments to keep pace, and coordination between multiple stakeholders would be challenging. Moreover, true privacy is already a fallacy in today’s geopolitical reality, as intelligence-sharing alliances such as the Five Eyes (US, UK, Australia, Canada, New Zealand) demonstrate. Surveillance and cyber warfare, exemplified by incidents such as NSA infiltration of Huawei servers and the creation of malware like ransomware-as-a-service, reveal that governments often prioritize access over privacy for strategic interests.
</p>
      <p>Legally, the situation differs by country. In the US, law enforcement cannot compel individuals to self-incriminate, and disclosure of encryption keys is voluntary. In contrast, the UK and Australia can legally force disclosure, while India’s IT Act allows imprisonment of up to seven years for noncompliance. Governments argue that encryption protects criminals and terrorists, and backdoors are essential for solving crimes and preventing attacks. However, backdoors also introduce major risks: they can be exploited by hackers, abused by repressive regimes to monitor dissent, and compromise cybersecurity if the master keys are breached. Such measures carry high costs, complicate business coordination, and can erode consumer trust. For example, foreign customers may avoid services perceived as compromised, and companies may face legal liabilities, as proposed in the US Senate in 2015.
</p>
      <p>Apple’s stance on privacy illustrates these tensions. Apple has made privacy a key marketing point, receiving top privacy ratings in 2015, in part because its business model does not rely on selling user data. While Apple stores significant data — including over 400 million iTunes accounts and associated credit card information — it does not monetize it in the same way as companies like Google, whose revenue depends heavily on advertising and data analytics. Globally, Apple faces regulatory pressures, notably in China, where it must store Chinese users’ data domestically. China has accused Apple of allowing backdoor access for the US government, prompting security audits. Apple has maintained it never compromised privacy or allowed backdoor access. These cases highlight the ongoing conflict between privacy, law enforcement, geopolitics, and corporate strategy. Ultimately, while some degree of privacy is necessary for everyday life, governments worldwide maintain that, for reasons of national security and crime prevention, personal privacy must have limitations.
