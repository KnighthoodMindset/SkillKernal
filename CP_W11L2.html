        <h3>Privacy regulation in europe - Part 2</h3>
    </section>
    <section>
      <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is founded on principles introduced by Ann Cavoukian, former Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario, Canada, who emphasized that “privacy knows no borders” and must be protected globally. She proposed seven principles forming the basis of GDPR, including full functionality—ensuring individuals have complete control over their data, and end-to-end security—embedding protection throughout the lifecycle of systems and applications. GDPR mandates absolute transparency so users know what data is collected and why, and stresses user-centric privacy, ensuring data is only accessed for legitimate purposes. It advocates proactive privacy measures from the design stage (“privacy by design”) and making privacy the default setting, embedding safeguards before systems are deployed.
</p>
      <p>Microsoft highlights GDPR requirements such as privacy by design and by default, emphasizing that privacy measures must align with the sensitivity of data and be embedded across IT systems, business processes, physical designs, and network architectures. GDPR also imposes strict record-keeping requirements, requiring organizations to maintain accurate logs of processing activities, data categories, third-party access, and records of breaches along with organizational responses. A crucial aspect is the Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA), which assesses risks of new data processing activities and mandates appropriate safeguards. GDPR requires immediate notification within 72 hours of data breaches to both authorities and affected individuals, along with technical and organizational measures to detect, report, and investigate breaches.
</p>
      <p>Regarding data transfers outside the EU, GDPR requires recipient countries to ensure adequate protection. When such protection is lacking, safeguards such as standard contractual clauses or binding corporate rules must be implemented. GDPR also stresses formal agreements between controllers and processors defining responsibilities for compliance and data protection. Compliance impacts organizations significantly, requiring appointment of a Data Protection Officer (DPO), implementation of DPIAs, employee training, heightened accountability, and immediate breach notification procedures. Severe penalties, including fines up to €20 million or 4% of global turnover, aim to deter non-compliance. Studies show GDPR enforcement has grown substantially, with significant fines imposed on companies like Amazon, Google, and British Airways, and COVID-19-related hybrid work modes increasing data breach risks due to weaker home security environments.
</p>
      <p>The way forward for GDPR suggests privacy will become the “new normal.” Customers will expect it, authorities will enforce it, and organizations will integrate it as a differentiator in competitive markets. Privacy certifications are becoming key buying factors, and GDPR compliance will continue to influence global privacy law developments. Over 120 countries, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, India, Israel, Japan, and members of the African Union, have enacted or are drafting privacy laws modeled on GDPR principles. Implementation remains a challenge, requiring harmonization across national and organizational levels, accounting for differences in culture, population, infrastructure, and technological capacity. Ultimately, raising awareness from early education and ensuring informed users will be vital in strengthening privacy protections globally, with people themselves playing the central role in upholding privacy rights.

      <p>If you want, I can also prepare a concise bullet-point summary of GDPR’s key requirements and principles from this transcript so it’s easier to study. That will make it much more useful for exam or project preparation.
