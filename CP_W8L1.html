      <p>Risk management involves three stages: <strong>identification, assessment</strong>, and <strong>decision-making</strong>. First, assets and threats must be identified — assets being what could be attacked and threats being the potential risks. Assessment involves quantifying the risk by determining asset value and threat probability. Two key measures are loss frequency (probability of attack × probability of success) and loss magnitude (asset value × exposure factor). These together help calculate residual risk, which is the remaining risk after applying protection mechanisms and considering measurement uncertainty.
</p>
      <p>Once risks are quantified for each asset, management must decide on an appropriate strategy. There are five primary risk management options: <strong>defense, transfer, mitigation, acceptance</strong>, and <strong>termination</strong>. Defense involves investing in safeguards, such as cyber technologies or hiring specialists, to reduce exposure to threats. Transfer involves outsourcing risk to third parties, such as managed services or cloud providers, which assume responsibility for cybersecurity under service agreements. Mitigation focuses on reducing the impact of attacks that have already occurred, for example, through contingency planning, hot sites, or disaster recovery strategies. Acceptance means consciously deciding to bear the risk when the cost of mitigation outweighs the benefit, based on economic justification. Termination involves discontinuing a risky business activity or asset when the cost of safeguarding exceeds the benefits.
</p>
      <p>Effective risk management also requires <abbr>economic justification</abbr>. This involves conducting a <abbr>cost-benefit analysis</abbr>, comparing the <abbr>Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)</abbr> before and after investment in security measures, against the <abbr>Annualized Cost of Safeguards (ACS)</abbr>. ALE is calculated by multiplying the loss magnitude by the expected frequency of occurrence annually. If ALE after implementing controls plus ACS is less than the initial ALE, the investment is justified. If the cost is too high, the control may not be viable. This process requires quantifying risks and translating them into monetary terms to support informed decision-making.
</p>
      <p>Finally, risk management is an ongoing process. Management must continuously monitor implemented controls to ensure they deliver expected gains, as initial estimates may differ from actual outcomes. This continuous monitoring ensures that cybersecurity investments remain effective and aligned with evolving threats.
