      <h4>Cybersecurity: Concepts, Scope, and Foundations</h4>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h4>1. Understanding Security in General</h4>
      <p>Before we define cybersecurity, it is important to understand the broader concept of <em>security</em>.</p>
      <p><strong>Security (general meaning):</strong> Security is the <em>state of being safe</em> or <em>feeling safe</em>. It is not only a technical matter but also has a psychological and emotional dimension.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>At an <strong>individual level</strong>, security means protecting life, health, and personal property.</li>
        <li>At an <strong>organizational level</strong>, security means protecting assets (both physical and informational) from theft, misuse, or damage.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> A security gate at an institute like IIT Madras ensures that only authorized individuals can enter, protecting both physical and informational assets.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h4>2. Security Concerns: Individual vs. Organization</h4>
      <p><strong>Individuals:</strong> Primarily concerned with personal safety and the protection of their private information.</p>
      <p><strong>Organizations:</strong> Must protect a wider array of assets, including employee data, intellectual property, and customer information.</p>
      <p><strong>Key Differences:</strong> Individuals focus on personal safety, whereas organizations must consider regulatory compliance and data protection.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h4>3. Information Security vs. Cybersecurity</h4>
      <p>Although related, there are important differences:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Information Security:</strong> Focuses on <em>protecting information and data</em> as an asset.<br>
        <em>Example:</em> Preventing unauthorized access to databases like hospital servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Cybersecurity:</strong> Is broader and includes:
          <ul>
            <li>Information security (data protection).</li>
            <li>Physical security of infrastructure.</li>
            <li>Personal and operational security.</li>
            <li>Protection of users themselves from cybercrimes.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>üëâ Cybersecurity = Information Security + Protection of Systems + Protection of People in the Cyber World.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> A drone attack involves both information security (intelligence gathering) and cybersecurity (protecting people and property from tech-based harm).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h4>4. Cybersecurity vs. Information Security ‚Äì Scope</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Information Security:</strong> About keeping data safe (confidentiality, integrity, and availability).</li>
        <li><strong>Cybersecurity:</strong> Broader, includes protection against threats in the entire <em>networked, internet-driven world</em>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Thus, while information security is a <em>subset</em>, cybersecurity is <em>all-inclusive</em>.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h4>5. The Meaning of the Term ‚ÄúCyber‚Äù</h4>
      <p>The prefix <strong>cyber</strong> comes from <em>cybernetics</em> (Greek origin), meaning ‚Äúto steer‚Äù or ‚Äúcontrol.‚Äù Since the 1990s, ‚Äúcyber‚Äù has been associated with the <em>internet-connected world</em>. Terms like <em>cyberspace</em>, <em>cybercrime</em>, and <em>cyberattack</em> are common today.</p>
      <p>So, <strong>cybersecurity = security of the networked, internet-driven world.</strong></p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h4>6. Variations in Writing Cybersecurity</h4>
      <p>There are three ways to write the word:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cyber security (two words ‚Äì common in Europe).</li>
        <li>Cyber-security (hyphenated ‚Äì often used in India).</li>
        <li>Cybersecurity (one word ‚Äì common in the US).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h4>7. Formal Definitions</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>ITU (International Telecommunication Union, 2008):</strong> Defines cybersecurity as encompassing <em>all aspects of securing cyberspace</em> ‚Äî including tools, technologies, policies, guidelines, best practices, training, and risk management.</li>
        <li><strong>Whitman and Mattord (2018):</strong> Information Security is the ‚Äúprotection of information and its critical elements, including the systems and hardware that use, store, and transmit that information.‚Äù</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h4>8. Three Key Goals of Cybersecurity: The CIA Triangle</h4>
      <p>Cybersecurity is often explained using the <strong>CIA Triad</strong>, which has three components:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Confidentiality</strong> ‚Äì ensuring only authorized users can access information.<br>
        <em>Example:</em> Using encryption to prevent outsiders from reading private messages.</li>
        <li><strong>Integrity</strong> ‚Äì ensuring data is accurate, consistent, and unaltered.<br>
        <em>Example:</em> Preventing hackers from modifying bank transaction records.</li>
        <li><strong>Availability</strong> ‚Äì ensuring information and systems are available when needed.<br>
        <em>Example:</em> Protecting websites from denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>These three goals form the foundation of cybersecurity efforts.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h4>9. Cybersecurity: Technology vs. Administration</h4>
      <p>Cybersecurity is not just a technical problem. It has three dimensions:</p>
      <h5>1. Technology Dimension</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Technology can be the threat (hackers using malicious tools).</li>
        <li>Technology is also the target (computers, IoT devices, databases).</li>
        <li>Technology is the defense (encryption, firewalls, intrusion detection systems).</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>2. Administrative Dimension</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Administrative controls are policies and procedures that govern how security is managed.</li>
        <li><em>Example:</em> Role-based access, security audits, and employee training.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>3. Regulatory Dimension</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Governments and international bodies define laws and policies for data protection.</li>
        <li><em>Example:</em> GDPR in Europe, Personal Data Protection Bill in India.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h4>10. Case Studies of Cybersecurity Breaches</h4>
      <p>Real-world cases show that breaches are both technical and administrative problems:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Target Corporation (2013‚Äì2014):</strong> Massive data breach exposed millions of customer records.</li>
        <li><strong>Sony Corporation (2014):</strong> A large cyberattack that shook both the company and government institutions.</li>
        <li><strong>Air India, Twitter, TCS breaches:</strong> Proved that even leading organizations are vulnerable.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These incidents highlight that cybersecurity requires <strong>strong technology, strict administration, and proper regulation.</strong></p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h4>11. Cybersecurity Management</h4>
      <p>Cybersecurity management is about <strong>planning and preparing for risks</strong>. Two key approaches are:</p>
      <h5>1. Risk Management (Preventive)</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Identifies potential threats.</li>
        <li>Implements safeguards to minimize risk before it occurs.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>2. Contingency Planning (Reactive)</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Deals with unexpected incidents when protection fails.</li>
        <li>Focuses on restoring systems and ensuring continuity.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Together, these approaches ensure resilience against cyberattacks.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h4>12. Cybersecurity and Privacy</h4>
      <p>Cybersecurity also extends to <strong>privacy protection</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Protecting individuals‚Äô personal data (social media, Aadhaar, financial data).</li>
        <li>Preventing cyberbullying, identity theft, and online harassment.</li>
        <li>Ensuring compliance with privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA, etc.).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h4>13. Course Learning Objectives (from the lecture)</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>To understand cybersecurity from both <strong>technological</strong> and <strong>administrative</strong> perspectives.</li>
        <li>To analyze cases of cyber breaches and learn from them.</li>

        <li>To explore both <strong>technical tools</strong> (like cryptography) and <strong>management policies</strong> for security.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h4>14. Key Takeaways</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Security</strong> is both physical and psychological, at individual and organizational levels.</li>
        <li><strong>Information Security</strong> focuses on protecting data, while <strong>Cybersecurity</strong> is broader, covering systems, people, and the digital environment.</li>
        <li><strong>CIA Triad</strong> (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) is the foundation of information security.</li>
        <li>Cybersecurity is not only a <strong>technology problem</strong>, but also an <strong>administrative</strong> and <strong>regulatory</strong> issue.</li>
        <li>Future cybersecurity strategies must balance <strong>technology, management, and policy</strong> for effective protection.</li>
      </ul>
