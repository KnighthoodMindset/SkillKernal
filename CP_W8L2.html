        <h3>Cybersecurity technologies - Part 2</h3>
    </section>
    <section>
      <p>Cybersecurity technologies form a critical part of cybersecurity management, helping organizations strengthen defenses and implement mitigation mechanisms to reduce cyber risk. These technologies span various domains, each requiring awareness from a managerial perspective rather than detailed technical design. Understanding them helps in making informed decisions to safeguard digital assets. Examples include access control mechanisms, firewalls, biometrics, cryptography, and encryption techniques.</p>
      <p><strong>Access Control</strong> is a key mechanism to ensure cybersecurity, directly tied to the CIA triad—confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Access control involves four steps: identification, authentication, authorization, and accountability. Identification establishes who the user is, and authentication verifies that claim using different methods such as passwords, passphrases, one-time passwords (OTP), smart cards, and biometrics (fingerprints, retina scans, iris scans, voice recognition, signatures). Multi-factor authentication, combining different methods (something you know, something you have, something you are), significantly strengthens access control.</p>
      <p>Biometric authentication has become common, but it comes with limitations such as false acceptance rate (FAR) and false rejection rate (FRR). These limitations create trade-offs between security and usability, and the optimal point is the <abbr>Crossover Error Rate (CER)</abbr>, where the rates of false acceptance and rejection are balanced. Biometric attributes such as fingerprints, iris patterns, and retinal vessels are unique identifiers, but practical challenges like wear and tear of fingerprints for manual laborers exist. Successful biometric systems often combine multiple biometric inputs to improve reliability, as seen in certain government projects in India for e-governance and ration distribution.</p>
      <p>Firewalls are another important cybersecurity technology, acting as barriers that control access to networks based on identity and defined rules. They separate trusted networks (internal systems) from untrusted networks (external systems) to prevent unauthorized access. A firewall often employs a <abbr>Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)</abbr>, which is a buffer network containing copies of resources. This allows external users controlled access to certain resources without directly accessing the trusted network, providing an extra layer of security. Proxy servers similarly serve as mediators between trusted and untrusted networks.</p>
      <p><abbr>Cryptography</abbr> protects data confidentiality during transmission. Even if unauthorized access occurs, cryptography ensures that the information remains unintelligible without the correct decryption key. Encryption transforms plaintext into ciphertext, and decryption reverses the process using keys. There are two major encryption types: <strong>symmetric key encryption</strong>, where the same key is used for encryption and decryption, and <strong>asymmetric key encryption</strong>, which uses separate public and private keys. Asymmetric encryption solves the key distribution problem inherent in symmetric encryption and enables secure communications over unsecured networks.</p>
      <p><abbr>Digital signatures and certificates</abbr> further enhance security by ensuring non-repudiation, proving the authenticity of a message and preventing the sender from denying their involvement. This is important in financial transactions, legal documents, and e-governance processes. Digital certificates, issued by trusted authorities, validate that a website or entity is genuine, protecting against spoofing and phishing.</p>
      <p>Encryption methods are varied. Broadly, they include <abbr>substitution, transposition</abbr>, and <abbr>XOR encryption</abbr>. Substitution replaces elements of plaintext with other characters based on a key (e.g., Caesar cipher), while transposition changes the positions of characters or bits. XOR encryption applies an exclusive OR logic operation to bits in the message. Poly-alphabetic substitution uses varying rules for different characters, making it more secure than mono-alphabetic substitution. Understanding these methods is important for grasping encryption fundamentals, even though modern encryption is far more complex and uses advanced algorithms and standards.</p>
      <p>In summary, cybersecurity technologies such as access control, biometrics, firewalls, cryptography, and encryption work together to protect information systems. They address different layers of security needs—preventing unauthorized access, ensuring safe communication, authenticating identities, and maintaining integrity and confidentiality of data. Awareness of these technologies and their trade-offs is essential for effective cybersecurity management.</p>
