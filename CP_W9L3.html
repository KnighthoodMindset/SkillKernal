        <h3>Foundations of privacy - Part 3</h3>
    </section>

      <h4>Privacy is Power – Case Study</h4>
      <p>In the digital era, the concept of privacy has become a form of power, as personal data shared online can significantly impact individuals’ professional and personal lives. The widespread use of the internet and social media platforms has made personal information easily accessible, allowing anyone to view a person’s lifestyle, opinions, and activities. While social media provides numerous benefits such as networking and global communication, it also introduces serious privacy threats, including social engineering, data misuse, and spear phishing attacks. The growing digital footprint of individuals has also transformed professional recruitment practices. Many organizations now assess potential candidates based on their online behavior and social media presence. A 2020 Harris Poll found that 71% of employers use social profiles for screening, and 55% have rejected candidates due to online content. Although this trend helps employers understand candidates better, it also raises ethical and privacy concerns, as irrelevant personal details—such as relationship status, health information, or political opinions—could lead to **bias, discrimination, and unfair hiring decisions.</p>
      <h4>Case Background – “We Googled You”</h4>
      <p>The case study titled “We Googled You” illustrates the complex relationship between privacy, digital information, and corporate decision-making. The case centers on <abbr>Hathaway Jones</abbr>, a luxury apparel retailer experiencing declining sales, which aimed to expand into the Chinese market. The company’s CEO, Fred Westen, wanted to recruit a strong leadership team for the expansion and was open to hiring exceptional talent without adhering to rigid procedures. The VP of HR, Virginia Flanders, however, insisted on conducting detailed background checks on all candidates. The candidate under consideration, Mimi Brewster, was a promising MBA graduate fluent in Chinese, with strong leadership and international experience. However, during a deep online search, HR discovered that Mimi had participated in protests against the WTO and Chinese authorities. This raised concerns for Hathaway Jones due to the potential political sensitivity and reputational risks associated with employing a politically active candidate in China. The company thus faced a dilemma: whether to respect Mimi’s right to privacy and focus on her qualifications or to consider the potential business risks of her activism.
</p>
      <h4>Ethical and Legal Concerns in Online Screening</h4>
      <p>The ethical question at the heart of the case was whether Googling a candidate’s background constitutes a violation of privacy. Since the information found was publicly available, most opinions held that it did not breach privacy. However, the extent and purpose of such searches must be carefully considered. While background checks are legitimate when conducted within reasonable limits, using unrelated personal information to make employment decisions can lead to **ethical violations and legal consequences. Organizations must ensure compliance with key privacy and employment laws such as the <abbr>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)</abbr> guidelines, the <abbr>National Labor Relations Act (NLRA)</abbr>, and the <abbr>Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)</abbr>. These frameworks emphasize transparency, consent, fairness, and non-discrimination. Companies are therefore advised to establish clear internet screening policies that define what types of information may be reviewed and how such data can influence hiring decisions.
</p>
      <h4>Decision-Making and Organizational Approach</h4>
      <p>In addressing the situation, several possible approaches were considered. The company could <abbr>confront Mimi Brewster</abbr> about the online findings, allowing her to explain her actions and clarify whether her past activism would affect her future professional conduct. Another approach could involve assigning her to U.S.-based roles instead of the Chinese division to avoid potential political complications. Alternatively, Hathaway Jones could seek a balanced solution that acknowledged her qualifications while mitigating reputational risks. The most favored approach was to speak directly with Mimi, ensuring fairness and transparency in the hiring process. This solution recognized her right to explain her past while also allowing the company to make an informed business decision. The discussion highlighted that **hiring decisions should always be based on merit, skills, and job relevance, not on political opinions, ideologies, or personal beliefs.
</p>
      <h4>Lessons for Individuals and Organizations</h4>
      <p>The case underscores vital lessons for both individuals and organizations operating in the digital age. For individuals, maintaining a professional and mindful online presence is essential. It is recommended to regularly review and manage social media profiles, use privacy settings appropriately, and even Google oneself periodically to understand what information is publicly visible. Setting up Google Alerts can help track new content related to one’s name. Maintaining separate personal and professional accounts ensures that private activities do not interfere with professional reputation. Moreover, individuals must remember that online content is permanent, and once shared, it can influence future opportunities indefinitely.
</p>
      <p>For organizations, the key takeaway is to balance privacy with legitimate business interests. Companies should design <abbr>ethical, transparent, and legally compliant background screening policies</abbr>. These should focus only on relevant professional information and avoid intrusion into personal lives. Fair hiring practices demand that decisions are made based on professional competence, not on personal ideologies or unrelated online activities. By doing so, organizations can protect both their reputation and the privacy rights of candidates, promoting <abbr>trust, fairness, and accountability</abbr> in the hiring process.
