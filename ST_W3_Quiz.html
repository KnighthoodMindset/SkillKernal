  <p>Which of the following represents a basic block in a control flow graph?</p>
  <label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="a"> A basic block of statements is a set of all statements that are a part of a function that the control flow graph represents.</label><br>
  <label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="b"> A basic block of statements is a sequence of statements such that if the first statement in the sequence is executed then all the statements in the sequence will also be executed.</label><br>
  <div class="answer" data-correct="A basic block of statements is a sequence of statements such that if the first statement in the sequence is executed then all the statements in the sequence will also be executed.">Correct Answer: A basic block of statements is a sequence of statements such that if the first statement in the sequence is executed then all the statements in the sequence will also be executed.</div>

<div class="question">
  <p>Consider a variable count of type int. Suppose there is a statement count++ in a method. Which of the following statements are correct regarding the data flow definition of count?</p>
  <label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="a"> The statement is a definition of count.</label><br>
  <label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="b"> The statement is a use of count.</label><br>
  <label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="c"> The statement is both a definition and use of count.</label><br>
  <label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="d"> The statement is neither a definition nor a use of count.</label><br>
  <div class="answer" data-correct="The statement is both a definition and use of count.">Correct Answer: The statement is both a definition and use of count.</div>
</div>

<div class="question">
  <p>Consider a variable x of type double. Suppose there is a statement if(Math.log(x) >= 4.2) in a method. Is this considered a definition or use of x?</p>
  <label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="a"> The statement is a definition of x.</label><br>
  <label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="b"> The statement is a use of x.</label><br>

</div>

<div class="question">
  <p>Which of the following best defines a du-path for a variable x?</p>
  <label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="a"> A du-path is a simple path from a definition of x to a use of x without any further definitions of x in-between.</label><br>
  <label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="b"> A du-path is a path from a definition of x to a use of x without any further definitions of x in-between.</label><br>

  <div class="answer" data-correct="No.">Correct Answer: No.</div>

<div class="question">
  <p>Which of the following statements are true when comparing traditional source code coverage criteria with graph-based coverage criteria?</p>
  <label><input type="radio" name="q8" value="a"> Node and statement coverage are the same, edge and branch coverage are the same.</label><br>
  <label><input type="radio" name="q8" value="b"> Edge and decision coverage are the same.</label><br>
  <div class="answer" data-correct="Node and statement coverage are the same, edge and branch coverage are the same.">Correct Answer: Node and statement coverage are the same, edge and branch coverage are the same.</div>
</div>

<div class="question">
  <p>Which of the following defines a linearly independent path of execution in a control flow graph?</p>
  <label><input type="radio" name="q9" value="a"> A path in which there are no branches.</label><br>
  <label><input type="radio" name="q9" value="b"> A path which does not contain other paths within it.</label><br>
