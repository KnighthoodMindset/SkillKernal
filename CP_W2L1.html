      <h4>Cybersecurity as an Administrative and Management Issue</h4>
      <p>Organizations need frameworks and standards to guide cybersecurity management. Decision-making related to cybersecurity—such as investment levels and policies—varies across organizations based on the criticality of their digital assets. For instance, while some organizations may invest heavily in cybersecurity like the Pentagon, others may choose moderate investments depending on their risk tolerance. Therefore, cybersecurity policies guide decisions and act as references for all security-related practices.</p>

      <h4>Three Dimensions of Cybersecurity</h4>
      <li>Technology as a Threat – Technology can be exploited to create cyber threats</li>
      <li>Technology as an Asset – Technological systems and data are assets that must be protected.</li>
      <li>Technology as a Tool – Technology itself serves as a defense mechanism or firewall to safeguard other assets.</li>
      <p>Cybersecurity requires a holistic approach that integrates all these three aspects, supported by management practices, technology, and human resources.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h4>Information Security and Its Constituents</h4>
      <p>Information security is a crucial part of cybersecurity. It is represented through three concentric components:</p>
      <li><strong>Network Security: </strong>Protecting data during transmission.</li>
      <li><strong>Computer and Data Security: </strong>Securing stored and processed data.</li>
      <li><strong>Management of Information Security: </strong>Formulating and implementing policies and controls.</li>
      <p>These three are interconnected through the policy layer, which serves as the foundation for decision-making. Data security must cover <abbr>data storage</abbr>, <abbr>data transmission</abbr>, and <abbr>data processing</abbr>, as threats can occur at any of these stages.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h4>The CIA Triangle – Core Objectives of Cybersecurity</h4>
      <p>The CIA Triangle is the most fundamental concept in cybersecurity, standing for:</p>
      <li><abbr>Confidentiality: </abbr>Ensuring that information is accessible only to authorized users.</li>
      <li><abbr>Integrity: </abbr>Ensuring that information remains accurate, complete, and unaltered.</li>
      <li><abbr>Availability: </abbr>Ensuring that information and systems are accessible when needed by authorized users.</li>
      <p>These three together represent the purpose of cybersecurity—to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information in the digital world.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h4>The McCumber Cube Model</h4>
      <p>The McCumber Cube, proposed by John McCumber, provides a holistic model for cybersecurity by combining three dimensions:</p>
      <p><strong>1. Computing Dimension: </strong>Data storage, processing, and transmission.</p>
      <p><strong>2. Security Objectives: </strong>Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.</p>
      <p><strong>3. Security Measures: </strong>Policy, Education, and Technology.</p>
      <p>Each “cell” of the cube represents the intersection of these dimensions, ensuring that no aspect of cybersecurity is overlooked. It encourages organizations to assess whether all areas of cybersecurity—technical, educational, and policy-related—are adequately addressed.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h4>Confidentiality</h4>
      <p>Confidentiality ensures that information is accessed only by intended recipients and not by unauthorized individuals. Human curiosity, malice, or error can lead to breaches of confidentiality. For example, when person A sends information to person B, the system must ensure that person C cannot intercept or read it. Techniques like <abbr>encryption</abbr> help achieve confidentiality by encoding information so that even if intercepted, it cannot be understood.</p>
      <p>In organizations, confidentiality is implemented through information classification and access control policies. For instance, salary data might be accessible only to HR or specific supervisors, not to other employees. National databases like Aadhaar must also ensure confidentiality, preventing unauthorized sharing of sensitive personal information. Confidentiality thus establishes trust between the <abbr>data subject</abbr> and the <abbr>data controller</abbr>, ensuring that consent and data-sharing contracts are respected.</p>
      <h4>Integrity</h4>
      <p>Integrity** means maintaining the <abbr>completeness, consistency, and accuracy</abbr> of data. Information should remain intact as it moves from sender to receiver. If data is lost, altered, or manipulated in transit, integrity is compromised. For example, if a résumé sent by an employee is modified or incomplete, or if a date of birth is wrongly entered into a database, the data’s integrity is lost.</p>
      <p>Integrity also involves allowing individuals to access and update their own data. According to privacy regulations, a data subject must have the right to correct or update their stored information. Ensuring integrity means preventing unauthorized alteration and allowing rightful modifications.</p>
      <h4>Availability</h4>
      <p>Availability ensures that data and systems are accessible to authorized users when required. It is the opposite of confidentiality in the sense that while data must not be available to unauthorized users, it must always be available to authorized ones. For instance, if an airline or IRCTC booking system is down when users need it, that reflects a failure of availability.</p>
      <p>Availability is maintained through reliability engineering and redundancy—having backup systems or servers that ensure continuous service even when one fails. Service Level Agreements (SLAs) often define the required level of availability, such as “99.999% uptime.” However, achieving 100% availability is nearly impossible and exponentially increases costs. Therefore, organizations balance cost and reliability to maintain practical availability standards.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p>In summary, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) form the foundational triad of cybersecurity. Every aspect of cybersecurity management—whether policy-making, education, or technology implementation—should aim to protect these three objectives. The <abbr>McCumber Cube</abbr> provides a comprehensive framework ensuring that organizations consider every dimension of security. Understanding and applying these principles enables organizations to build secure, reliable, and trustworthy digital environments.</p>
