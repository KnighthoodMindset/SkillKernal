        <h3>Security Management, GRC - Part 1</h3>
    </section>
    <section>
      <p>In this session of the course Cybersecurity and Privacy, the focus is on <abbr>Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)</abbr>, a widely used management framework in cybersecurity. Unlike technology-focused approaches, GRC treats cybersecurity as a management challenge, integrating it into the broader enterprise governance and risk management structure. At its core, GRC addresses three fundamental aspects: governance, risk, and compliance. Governance refers to the overarching structures, policies, and processes that direct and monitor an organization’s strategic objectives. Risk pertains to the potential threats that could harm the organization’s assets — in this case, cyber assets — and requires systematic assessment and mitigation strategies. Compliance involves adhering to laws, regulations, and standards relevant to cybersecurity. The session emphasizes that cyber threats are growing both in volume and impact, citing high-profile incidents such as the Marriott breach affecting 500 million records and the Target breach, illustrating that no organization is immune. These incidents underscore that cybersecurity should not be treated as an afterthought but as a strategic priority embedded within an organization’s governance framework.</p>

      <p>Three broad approaches to cybersecurity management are discussed. The first is the <abbr>GRC approach</abbr>, which incorporates cybersecurity as part of enterprise risk management (ERM), alongside other risk domains like operational or market risk. This holistic view integrates cybersecurity into the organization’s overall governance, compliance, and risk management policies. The second is the <abbr>standards-driven approach</abbr>, which treats cybersecurity as a standalone discipline managed through frameworks like ISO or NIST standards. These standards guide organizations in implementing best practices to secure cyber assets and can be applied independently or within a broader GRC structure. The third is the <abbr>organizational planning approach</abbr>, which treats cybersecurity as a strategic priority, incorporating it into contingency planning and strategic decision-making without necessarily following formal standards. This approach emphasizes proactive preparation, aligning cybersecurity with organizational goals.</p>

      <p>The lecture further explains the concept of governance in cybersecurity, describing it as the higher-order function above management. Governance ensures that management structures and processes are in place, monitored, and aligned with strategic priorities. This concept is reflected in established frameworks such as COBIT, COSO, and COSO ERM. COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies), developed by ISACA, provides a comprehensive IT governance framework, integrating governance and management to safeguard organizational health end-to-end. COBIT emphasizes a continuous process cycle of planning, building, running, and monitoring, ensuring that cybersecurity is embedded in organizational strategy and operations. COSO (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations) originates from the accounting profession and focuses on internal controls to safeguard assets, ensure accurate reporting, maintain operational efficiency, and comply with laws and regulations. COSO ERM extends COSO by incorporating risk assessment and response, creating a closed-loop system for enterprise risk management. These frameworks highlight that governance in cybersecurity is not merely about technical controls but about embedding a structured, strategic approach to managing cyber risk, ensuring alignment with organizational objectives, and building resilience against evolving threats.</p>

      <p>The session concludes with the insight that cybersecurity management must be proactive, strategic, and integrated into the organization’s governance structure. As Louis Pasteur’s famous quote reminds us, “Fortune favors the prepared mind.” Organizations must accept that cyber risk is inevitable and adopt structured frameworks like GRC to prepare for the unpredictable future. By treating cybersecurity as a governance issue rather than purely a technical challenge, organizations can safeguard their assets more effectively, ensure compliance, and maintain the trust of stakeholders. This perspective establishes the foundation for deeper exploration of risk management and compliance in later sessions.</p>
