        <h3>Input Space partitioning : Coverage criteria</h3>
    </section>
    <section>
      <p>In functional testing, input <abbr>space partitioning (ISP)</abbr> is a crucial method used for designing test cases based on how input domains are divided into meaningful partitions. Each input variable of a program has its own domain, and these domains can be partitioned in multiple ways depending on the testing requirements and objectives. Two primary types of partitioning methods are used: <strong>interface-based</strong> and <strong>functionality-based</strong>. Interface-based partitioning focuses on each input variable separately, creating partitions based on its characteristics, while functionality-based partitioning considers the overall behavior or functionality of the program under test, combining the inputs in a manner that reflects how they interact functionally. Once the input domains are partitioned, the challenge lies in how to combine these partitions efficiently to ensure adequate coverage without excessive redundancy. This leads to the definition of several coverage criteria that determine how combinations of partitions should be selected for test case generation.
</p>
      <p>The first coverage criterion is <abbr>All Combinations Coverage (ACoC)</abbr>, which represents exhaustive testing with respect to input partitions. It requires taking every possible combination of blocks from all partitions of the input domain. For instance, if the first input is divided into two partitions, the second into three, and the third into two, the total number of test cases generated would be the product of all partition counts, which in this case would be twelve. Although ACoC ensures maximum coverage, it is not an intelligent or efficient testing method because it leads to a combinatorial explosion in the number of test cases. Therefore, it is generally used only when the number of partitions is small or when complete exhaustive testing is feasible.
</p>
      <p>The second coverage criterion is <abbr>Each Choice Coverage (ECC)</abbr>, which takes the opposite approach to ACoC. Instead of combining all possible partitions, ECC selects only one representative value from each partition or block. This drastically reduces the number of test cases, as only the maximum number of partitions among all inputs determines the total count of tests. However, ECC is considered a weak coverage criterion because it may miss critical interactions between inputs, resulting in untested combinations that could contain faults. It provides minimal coverage and is typically used when testing resources are very limited or when only a high-level verification of inputs is needed.
</p>
      <p>A more balanced approach between exhaustive and minimal coverage is <abbr>Pairwise Coverage</abbr>, which ensures that every possible pair of partitions from different input variables is tested at least once. This means that all combinations of two characteristics are covered without testing every full combination. Pairwise coverage significantly reduces the number of test cases compared to ACoC while maintaining a high fault detection capability because many faults are caused by interactions between two input parameters. Pairwise coverage can be generalized into <em>T-Wise Coverage</em>, where combinations of T inputs are tested together. For example, pairwise corresponds to T=2, while higher values of T cover more complex interactions. However, as T increases, the number of required test cases grows exponentially, making higher-order T-wise coverage impractical beyond a certain limit.
</p>
      <p>The final two coverage criteria are <abbr>Base Choice Coverage (BCC)</abbr> and <abbr>Multiple Base Choice Coverage (MBCC)</abbr>, which aim to make test case selection more focused rather than arbitrary. In BCC, one partition from each input variable is selected as the “base choice,” representing the most important or typical value. A base test is first created using these base choices, and then additional tests are generated by varying one input at a time while keeping others fixed at their base choices. This ensures that every non-base value is tested at least once in combination with the base choices. MBCC extends this idea by allowing multiple base choices for each input characteristic instead of just one. It provides more thorough coverage than BCC because it tests the influence of several significant input values instead of a single one. The total number of tests in MBCC equals the number of base tests plus one for each non-base block across all partitions.
</p>
      <p>Together, these six coverage criteria—All Combinations Coverage, Each Choice Coverage, Pairwise Coverage, T-Wise Coverage, Base Choice Coverage, and Multiple Base Choice Coverage—form the foundation for systematic test case generation in input space partitioning. Among them, ACoC offers complete but expensive coverage, ECC provides minimal coverage, and Pairwise or T-Wise offer balanced options. Base Choice and Multiple Base Choice introduce intelligent focus on important input combinations. While there are no strict subsumption relationships between pairwise and base choice criteria, ACoC subsumes all others due to its exhaustive nature, and MBCC subsumes BCC. In practice, testers often prefer Pairwise or Base Choice coverage for achieving effective, efficient, and meaningful test suites that balance thoroughness and effort.
