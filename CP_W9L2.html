        <h3>Foundations of privacy - Part 2</h3>

      <p><strong>Economic and Feminist Perspectives on Privacy</strong> add further depth to understanding privacy beyond its technical and legal aspects. From an economic viewpoint, privacy becomes significant when breaches have economic consequences. Organizations store extensive personal data, and its leakage can result in financial loss, reputational damage, and liability. Identity theft is another example of privacy’s economic impact. This perspective underlines why privacy protection is important for both individuals and businesses, and why economics of privacy is an emerging field of study.
</p>
      <p>The feminist perspective offers a critical view of privacy, particularly the concept of private space. Feminist scholars argue that defining certain spaces, such as the family, as entirely private can disadvantage women. In many communities, women face abuse and violence that go unchecked without oversight. Therefore, absolute boundaries around privacy can, in some cases, protect perpetrators and not victims. This perspective highlights that privacy is not just a technical or legal issue but is deeply intertwined with social structures and power relations.
</p>
      <p><abbr>Information Privacy</abbr> — a core focus area — is defined by Alan Westin as the claim of individuals, groups, or institutions to determine when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated to others. Essentially, Information Privacy is the ability of an individual to control their personal information. Unlike general privacy, which includes the right to be let alone, Information Privacy specifically concerns control over one’s data. With the rise of technology, especially in the digital era, Information Privacy has become increasingly important. Organizations and governments collect, store, and analyze large amounts of personal data, raising concerns about unauthorized use, secondary usage, and data security.
</p>
      <p>To address these concerns, the <abbr>Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPP)</abbr> were developed by the U.S. Secretary’s Advisory Committee on Automated Personal Data Systems in 1973. FIPP provides foundational principles for Information Privacy, influencing privacy regulations worldwide. These principles include transparency (no secret data collection), access (right to know and correct stored data), purpose limitation (data collected for one purpose should not be used for another without consent), data minimization (collect only necessary data), and accountability (data collectors must secure and ensure accuracy of data).
</p>
      <p>In the modern regulatory landscape, three key entities are central to Information Privacy: the <abbr>Data Subject</abbr> (individual whose data is collected), the <abbr>Data Controller</abbr> (entity deciding how data is collected, stored, and processed), and the <abbr>Data Processor</abbr> (entity processing data on behalf of the controller). These roles are fundamental to privacy laws such as GDPR in Europe and India's proposed Personal Data Protection Act.
</p>
      <p>Researchers have identified four measurable dimensions of concern for Information Privacy: <abbr>collection</abbr> (why and how data is collected), <abbr>unauthorized access</abbr> (who can access data), <abbr>errors</abbr> (accuracy of stored data), and <abbr>secondary use</abbr> (whether data is used for purposes other than originally intended). These dimensions help assess the level of privacy risk and guide organizational and regulatory strategies.
</p>
      <p>The growing importance of Information Privacy is driven by the <strong>Information Era</strong>, where vast amounts of data are collected, stored, and transmitted efficiently. While this enables convenience and innovation, it also increases the potential for misuse, breaches, and harm to individuals’ personal lives, reputations, and careers. High-profile cases of data breaches have underscored the critical need for robust privacy protections. As a result, organizations are establishing dedicated privacy offices alongside security teams to address these risks.
</p>
      <p>For individuals, privacy matters not only for legal protection but also to prevent harm, embarrassment, and loss of control over personal life. Cases like *Database Nations* highlight how profiling by businesses and inadequate regulation can harm individuals, especially when legal systems side with business interests over individual privacy. Privacy agreements and terms and conditions also shift the balance, often leaving individuals with limited recourse once consent is given.
</p>
      <p>Finally, privacy is both a personal and collective issue. In the digital age, everything individuals do leaves a record. These records are rarely deleted by organizations, raising long-term concerns about control over personal information. The <strong>We Google You</strong>5 case exemplifies how privacy issues involve the interplay between individuals, organizations, and society, and why understanding Information Privacy is critical in today’s interconnected world.
