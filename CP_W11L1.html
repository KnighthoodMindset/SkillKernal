        <h3>Privacy regulation in europe - Part 1</h3>
    </section>
    <section>
      <p>In the eleventh session of the Cybersecurity and Privacy course, the discussion focused on data protection regulations and the growing importance of safeguarding personal data. It was noted that data privacy is a fundamental need for individuals, as they want to protect their information from exploitation. However, the data ecosystem involves multiple stakeholders with potentially conflicting interests — for example, businesses and governments often seek personal data for various purposes, while individuals value their privacy. This creates the need for regulation to balance these interests. Without regulation, dominant players can exploit data to their advantage, making regulation a necessity to protect individuals. Cases from the United States, such as those involving Target Corporation, Google, YouTube, and Equifax, illustrate shortcomings in existing laws, particularly the absence of strong, uniform rules for prevention, breach reporting, and penalties. Although laws such as the FTC guidelines, HIPAA for healthcare, and child-specific protections exist, the U.S. lacks a comprehensive overarching regulation for data protection.
</p>
      <p>Attention was drawn to emerging challenges in virtual worlds like the Meta, where real-world identities are not required, making privacy concerns different from the physical world. In the real world, data is linked to actual individuals, so privacy protection is critical. Against this backdrop, the session shifted focus to the European Union’s <abbr>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</abbr>, which became enforceable in May 2018, replacing the earlier Data Protection Directive (DPD). GDPR applies to all EU member states and to organizations processing data of EU residents, regardless of where the organization is based. It governs the storage, processing, and sharing of personal data — defined broadly to include not only direct identifiers like name and email but also indirect identifiers such as biometric data, device IDs, geolocation, and IP addresses when combined with other data.
</p>
      <p>GDPR established six core principles for data protection: lawfulness, fairness, and transparency; purpose limitation; data minimization; data accuracy; storage limitation; and confidentiality, security, and integrity. It places responsibility on both <abbr>data controllers</abbr> (those who determine the purposes of data processing) and <abbr>data processors</abbr> (those processing data on behalf of controllers). The regulation also mandates that processing personal data must be based on a legal basis, including consent, vital interest, contractual necessity, public interest, legal obligation, and legitimate interest.
</p>
      <p>GDPR introduces stricter requirements compared to earlier laws. Organizations must obtain clear consent, be transparent about how data is used, provide access and correction rights to individuals, and implement safeguards. Individuals are empowered with rights such as access, correction, deletion, restriction of processing, and data portability. GDPR also requires organizations to appoint a <abbr>Data Protection Officer (DPO)</abbr> and conduct <abbr>Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA)</abbr> for high-risk projects, ensuring privacy by design.
</p>
      <p>Non-compliance with GDPR carries heavy penalties — fines up to €20 million or 4% of global annual turnover, whichever is higher. Cases such as fines against Amazon, WhatsApp, Google, and British Airways illustrate these consequences. GDPR also mandates breach notification within 72 hours of discovery. Transparency is a key feature, requiring organizations to disclose why data is collected, how long it is stored, and with whom it is shared.
</p>
      <p>Overall, GDPR represents a landmark regulation in data privacy, shifting from a directive approach to a binding law with stricter enforcement and wider scope. It strengthens individual rights, broadens the definition of personal data, places joint responsibility on controllers and processors, and mandates stronger accountability measures for organizations handling personal data.
