        <h3>Privacy: The Indian Way - Part 2</h3>
    </section>
    <section>
      <p>Aadhaar, launched under the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), represents one of the most ambitious government initiatives aimed at establishing a unique identity for every Indian citizen. It operates under the legal framework of the Aadhaar Act, which was passed by Parliament to ensure its compliance with the “procedure established by law” under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution. The program was primarily designed to address issues of identity duplication, corruption, and inefficiency in welfare delivery systems, where individuals could exploit multiple identities to obtain undue benefits. By assigning a unique 12-digit identification number to each citizen, Aadhaar sought to streamline service delivery, promote transparency, and reduce leakages in the distribution of government subsidies and welfare schemes. Spearheaded by Nandan Nilekani, the initiative evolved into the world’s largest identification project, integrating various government and private service providers through a centralized digital platform.
</p>
      <p>However, Aadhaar’s implementation brought significant privacy and data security concerns due to the mandatory collection of biometric and demographic information. The Supreme Court intervened to ensure a balance between citizens’ right to privacy and the government’s need for administrative efficiency, restricting the compulsory use of Aadhaar to specific government services. Despite these legal safeguards, the risks associated with data breaches and unauthorized access remain pressing issues. Although the government maintains that Aadhaar data is protected by multiple layers of security, researchers have identified vulnerabilities within the system, particularly through third-party vendors and authentication devices used during enrollment and verification processes. These weak points could potentially enable profiling or misuse of personal data when Aadhaar numbers are linked with other databases.
</p>
      <p>While the UIDAI introduced mechanisms such as pseudo-identifiers to minimize privacy risks, the overall architecture still relies heavily on secure data handling by various intermediaries, including Authentication Service Agencies (ASA) and Authentication User Agencies (AUA). Instances of data leaks and misuse prompted the government to take corrective measures, including penalizing vendors responsible for breaches. The Aadhaar project, therefore, stands as a complex intersection of technology, law, and ethics—striving to balance the state’s pursuit of efficiency and inclusivity with the constitutional obligation to protect individual privacy. The ongoing public and legal debates surrounding Aadhaar underscore its dual nature as both a tool for social empowerment and a potential threat to digital privacy in modern governance.
