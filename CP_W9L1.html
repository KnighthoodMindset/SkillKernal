        <h3>Foundations of privacy - Part 1</h3>
    </section>

      <p>Cybersecurity Technologies and Privacy cover critical concepts in protecting digital information and ensuring individual rights. Cybersecurity technologies include access control mechanisms for identification, authentication, and authorization. Despite strong access control, unauthorized access can still occur, making encryption a vital layer of defence. Encryption protects transmitted data so that even if intercepted, the intruder cannot decipher it. It is central to trust in digital systems such as e-commerce and secure communication.
</p>
      <p>Blockchain technology is a significant advancement in cybersecurity. It ensures confidentiality through encryption, non-repudiation through unique private keys for transactions, and immutability through cryptographic hash functions. A block once created cannot be altered without detection, ensuring the integrity of data. Industry encryption standards have evolved over time. Initially, the Data Encryption Standard (DES) was widely used but later replaced by more secure standards such as Triple DES, Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), and RSA, offering key lengths of 128, 192, or 256 bits. The difficulty of breaking such encryption ensures robust data protection, making unauthorized decryption virtually impossible.
</p>
      <p>Privacy is closely linked to cybersecurity but addresses broader concerns about the right to control personal information. Privacy is not absolute; it involves a balance between individual autonomy and public interest. Encryption secures communication, but privacy risks arise in cases such as data backups, which may not be encrypted, leading to potential breaches, as illustrated by incidents involving WhatsApp message leaks. Privacy involves legal, ethical, and political dimensions, and government access to private data often raises debate over rights and security.
</p>
      <p>Historically, privacy as a concept emerged prominently in the late 19th century. In 1890, Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis published “The Right to Privacy,” defining privacy as the “right to be let alone.” Advances in technology, such as photography, highlighted the need for privacy protection by enabling intrusion into personal spaces. Privacy relates to individual freedom and autonomy — the ability to control one’s own actions, decisions, and personal space without external interference. Legal frameworks generally protect privacy but allow exceptions under certain conditions such as national security, subject to regulation and oversight.
</p>
      <p>Philosophically, privacy is framed within the public-private debate. Greek thinkers like Aristotle distinguished between the public sphere (“polis”) and the private sphere (“oikos”). This distinction underlines the need for rules in public spaces while preserving autonomy in private ones. Privacy thus remains a dynamic concept, shaped by technology, legal frameworks, ethical considerations, and societal values. It is an essential aspect of both personal liberty and cybersecurity governance.
