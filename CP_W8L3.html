      <p><strong>Active Defence and Hacking Back</strong> refers to strategies used to respond to cyber threats beyond passive protection. Active defence involves taking direct action after detecting an intrusion to destroy, nullify, or reduce the effectiveness of a cyber threat against assets. It is not inherently offensive or dangerous if implemented correctly. The concept goes beyond deploying security software and monitoring systems — it focuses on responding dynamically to attacks to safeguard critical information and systems.
</p>
      <p>Experts such as Dorothy Denning and Robert M. Lee highlight its importance. Dorothy Denning emphasizes that active defence should be understood as a calculated and lawful measure. Robert M. Lee provides real-world examples, including the detection of targeted malware in 2017 by his firm Dragos, which was aimed at damaging industrial control systems. This example underlines the necessity of proactive cyber defence measures.
</p>
      <p>A notable case of active defence is the response by the Georgian government to a cyberattack by Russian hackers. Instead of isolating their systems, Georgia deployed spyware disguised as targeted documents. This spyware traced back into the attacker’s system, captured information, and provided evidence for legal action. While such measures can be effective, they raise legal and ethical concerns, as they can be considered hacking without explicit authorization.
</p>
      <p>Hacking back is a form of counterattack intended to identify attackers, recover stolen data, and gather intelligence. Proponents argue it helps determine the source of intrusion, recover sensitive information, and assist law enforcement. However, there are significant risks: it may be illegal without proper authority, cause harm to innocent third parties, fail to identify the attacker, or compromise broader government and organizational operations. Ethical concerns also arise, particularly regarding proportionality, human oversight, and the protection of civil liberties such as privacy and free speech.
</p>
      <p>Active defence strategies exist on a spectrum. At one end is passive defence, such as antivirus software and firewalls, and at the other is offensive cyber operations. Between these extremes lie varying approaches, including intrusion monitoring, intelligence gathering, information sharing, and targeted countermeasures such as white hat ransomware or shutting down botnets. These strategies require careful consideration of legal authority, proportionality of response, protection of third parties, accountability, and civil liberties.
</p>  
      <p>The concept of a “grey zone” emerges in active defence — the balance between effective protection and potential legal or ethical violations. For organizations, it is essential to develop an active defence strategy grounded in ethical principles and legal compliance while ensuring the protection of critical systems and national security interests.
